# Checklist

_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You should fill these out after creating the PR. Filling these out will expedite the PR review process._

- [ ] Lint, unit, and end-to-end tests pass locally with my changes — we **really** like the colour green.
- [ ] My PR contains only changes relevant to the problem I am working on — because that is the cool part.
- [ ] My commits are short and to the point and contains only changes relevant to the commit message — less really is more.
- [ ] My PR is not trying to save the world — small steps will get you there in the end .. safe and sound.
- [ ] I have written and/or updated the unit and end-to-end test for the problem I am working on — again .. green colours.
- [ ] I have spread around comments with a generous hand — rather point out the obvious than hide behind obscurity.
- [ ] I have written and/or updated the documentation on GitBook — because the maintainers need some good-night reading.
